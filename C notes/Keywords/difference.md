### **Keywords**
1. **Definition**:
   - Keywords are **reserved words** that have special meanings and functions in the C language.
   - They are predefined by the language and cannot be changed or redefined.

2. **Purpose**:
   - Keywords define the syntax and structure of the program.
   - They are used to declare data types, control program flow, define functions, and more.

3. **Examples**:
   - `int`, `char`, `float`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `return`, `struct`, `typedef`, etc.

4. **Rules**:
   - Keywords must be written in **lowercase**.
   - They cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names).
   - They cannot be redefined or overloaded.

5. **Number**:
   - There are **32 keywords** in the standard C language.

6. **Usage**:
   - Keywords are used to define the structure and behavior of the program.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int main() {
         if (1) {
             return 0;
         }
     }
     ```

### **Identifiers**
1. **Definition**:
   - Identifiers are names given by the programmer to various program elements such as variables, functions, arrays, structures, etc.
   - They are **user-defined** and not predefined by the language.

2. **Purpose**:
   - Identifiers are used to uniquely identify program elements in the code.

3. **Examples**:
   - Variable names: `age`, `salary`, `totalAmount`.
   - Function names: `calculateSum`, `printMessage`.
   - Structure names: `Point`, `Employee`.

4. **Rules**:
   - Identifiers can consist of letters (`a-z`, `A-Z`), digits (`0-9`), and underscores (`_`).
   - The first character must be a letter or an underscore (not a digit).
   - Identifiers are **case-sensitive** (e.g., `myVar` and `myvar` are different).
   - They cannot be the same as C keywords.
   - They should be meaningful and follow naming conventions (e.g., snake_case or camelCase).

5. **Number**:
   - There is no limit to the number of identifiers in a program (as long as they follow the rules).

6. **Usage**:
   - Identifiers are used to name variables, functions, and other program elements.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int age = 25; // 'age' is an identifier
     void printMessage() { // 'printMessage' is an identifier
         printf("Hello, World!\n");
     }
     ```

### **Key Differences Between Keywords and Identifiers**

| Feature                | **Keywords**                              | **Identifiers**                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Predefined reserved words with special meanings. | User-defined names for program elements. |
| **Purpose**             | Define the syntax and structure of the program. | Identify variables, functions, etc.     |
| **Examples**            | `int`, `if`, `else`, `return`, `for`.    | `age`, `salary`, `calculateSum`.         |
| **Case Sensitivity**    | Must be written in lowercase.             | Case-sensitive (e.g., `myVar` â‰  `myvar`).|
| **User-Defined**        | No, predefined by the language.           | Yes, created by the programmer.          |
| **Number**              | Fixed (32 keywords in C).                 | Unlimited (depends on the program).      |
| **Rules for Naming**    | Cannot be changed or redefined.           | Must follow identifier naming rules.     |
| **Usage**               | Used to define program structure.         | Used to name program elements.           |

### **Examples Highlighting the Differences**

#### Example 1: Keywords in Use
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() { // 'int' and 'return' are keywords
    int age = 25; // 'int' is a keyword, 'age' is an identifier
    if (age > 18) { // 'if' is a keyword
        printf("You are an adult.\n"); // 'printf' is an identifier (library function)
    }
    return 0; // 'return' is a keyword
}
```

#### Example 2: Identifiers in Use
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// 'calculateSum' is an identifier (function name)
int calculateSum(int a, int b) { // 'a' and 'b' are identifiers (parameters)
    return a + b; // 'return' is a keyword
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 10; // 'num1' is an identifier
    int num2 = 20; // 'num2' is an identifier
    int result = calculateSum(num1, num2); // 'result' is an identifier
    printf("Sum: %d\n", result); // 'printf' is an identifier
    return 0;
}
```

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Using Keywords as Identifiers**:
   - Example: `int return = 10;` is invalid because `return` is a keyword.

2. **Misspelling Keywords**:
   - Example: `flaot salary;` is invalid because `float` is misspelled.

3. **Starting Identifiers with a Digit**:
   - Example: `int 1var;` is invalid because identifiers cannot start with a digit.

4. **Using Special Characters in Identifiers**:
   - Example: `int total$amount;` is invalid because `$` is not allowed.

---

### **Summary**
- **Keywords** are predefined reserved words with fixed meanings, used to define the structure and behavior of a program.
- **Identifiers** are user-defined names given to variables, functions, and other program elements.
- Keywords cannot be used as identifiers, and identifiers must follow specific naming rules.
